# CS-230-Software-Design-Document

The Gaming Room client wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms. The game that they wish to creat is Draw It or Lose It. The client wanted the gaming application to be available on multiple different platforms and be available on both the Apple and Android stores. Draw It or Lose It is a team based game where drawings are rendered at a steady rate and teams must guess the puzzle before time expires.

The things that I feel I did well with this software design document was breaking down the UML model as well as figuring out the design restraints.

When working through a design document, it helps break down the development of your project and you are able to think of it in smaller parts rather than just the whole project at once. This helps fight against the feeling of being overwlemed and gives you a much more thorough view of the project.

One part that I would choose to revise would be the evaluation section. I focused to heavily on finding round about ways to make mobile development work to the point where it still wasn't very feasible. I would like to do more in depth research on the server side of operating platforms to grasp a stronger understanding of the subject.

The way I interpreted the user's needs was trying to get the most performance possible to make the user experience the best that I could make it. The reason that it is so important to consider the user's needs when designing is because the user is the heart of the entire program. We are building an application with the user in mind, so we need to ensure that their experience is the best it can be whether its performance, ease of use, or security.

When approaching the design of Draw It or Lose It, I tried to take a more analytical approach. I wanted to truly analyze what the client wanted to understand design constraints as well as ensure the user has a good experience. The stategy that I would use in the future to analyze and design software applications would be to take it more slowly and look at one item at a time. I will also try to focus a lot more on how certain aspects in the design correlate with the project itself and talk more about how it impacts the application.
